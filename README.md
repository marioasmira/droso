# `droso` R package

This R package facilitates the data analysis of a purpose-built simulation model exploring the evolution of anticipatory parental effects [1].
The data analysis repository can be found at [marioasmira/droso_analysis](https://github.com/marioasmira/droso_analysis).
The package `rcspline` was made to facilitate the calculation of restricted cubic splines and is required to use this package.
Installed via `devtools::install_github('marioasmira/rcspline')`.[2]

The main purpose of this package is to use the `fly` class to mimic the individual based model that generated the data and facilitate the analysis.
Other useful functions are also included.
